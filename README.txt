Version 0.0.1

The arduino firmware was written for and tested with an arduino UNO. It will probably only work what an UNO without a fair bit of work.

Usage:

1. upload the firmware (usb_stepper.ino) to your arduino uno using the arduino IDE.
2. install the python api: from within arduino_stepper/python run:
        python setup.py install
3. import arduino_stepper.arduino_stepper to get access to the class that serves as the python API

Examples:

see the folder python/examples.
